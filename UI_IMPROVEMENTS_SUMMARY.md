# GenHRL UI System Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the four major improvements implemented in the GenHRL UI system to enhance user experience and training functionality.

## 1. Terminal Scrolling Enhancement

### Problem
The terminal and debug outputs in the UI lacked proper scrolling functionality, making it difficult to view long outputs during task generation and training processes.

### Solution Implemented
Enhanced terminal scrolling capabilities across multiple components:

**Files Modified:**
- `ui/client/src/components/TrainingProgressModal.js`
- `ui/client/src/pages/CreateTask.js`

**Key Changes:**
- Added `h-full overflow-y-auto` classes to terminal containers
- Implemented `relative` positioning for parent containers
- Removed auto-scroll behavior to give users full manual control
- Set `scrollBehavior: 'auto'` for responsive scrolling
- Set proper `maxHeight: '100%'` styles for optimal viewing
- Applied custom scrollbar styling with `custom-scrollbar dark-scrollbar` classes
- Added manual scroll controls: "Top" and "Bottom" buttons in terminal headers
- Added "Go to bottom" floating button when user scrolls up from bottom

**Impact:**
- Users have full manual control over terminal scrolling
- No more unwanted auto-scrolling interrupting user's reading
- Easy navigation with dedicated scroll controls
- Users can freely scroll through long terminal outputs without interference
- Both training progress and task generation terminals now have proper manual scrolling

## 2. Training Order by Hierarchy Levels

### Problem
The original training order processed skills hierarchically (children before parents), but the desired behavior was to train all primitives first, then level 1 composites, then level 2 composites, etc.

### Solution Implemented
Complete rewrite of the training order logic in the orchestrator:

**Files Modified:**
- `genhrl/training/orchestrator.py`

**Key Changes:**
- Replaced `_get_hierarchical_training_order()` method with level-based organization
- Added new `_collect_skills_by_level()` method to recursively collect skills by hierarchy level
- Added `get_skill_level()` method to determine skill hierarchy level:
  - Level 0: Primitive skills (leaf nodes)
  - Level 1+: Composite skills based on maximum depth of sub-skills
- Modified training order to process: Level 0 → Level 1 → Level 2 → etc.

**Training Order Logic:**
```python
def _get_hierarchical_training_order(self, hierarchy_node: Dict) -> List[str]:
    """Determine training order by hierarchy levels: primitives first, then level 1, then level 2."""
    skills_by_level = {}
    self._collect_skills_by_level(hierarchy_node, 0, skills_by_level)
    
    ordered_skills = []
    max_level = max(skills_by_level.keys()) if skills_by_level else 0
    
    for level in range(max_level + 1):
        if level in skills_by_level:
            ordered_skills.extend(skills_by_level[level])
    
    return ordered_skills
```

**Impact:**
- Training now follows a logical progression from simple to complex skills
- All primitive skills are trained first, providing a solid foundation
- Composite skills are trained in appropriate dependency order

## 3. Correct Training Script Selection

### Problem
The system needed to ensure that the correct training scripts (`train.py`, `train_l1.py`, `train_l2.py`) are used based on the skill hierarchy level.

### Solution Implemented
Enhanced training command generation with skill level-based script selection:

**Files Modified:**
- `genhrl/training/orchestrator.py`
- `ui/server/app.py`

**Key Changes:**
- Modified `_train_single_skill()` to use skill level for script selection
- Added consistent logic in both orchestrator and UI backend
- Implemented fallback mechanism for higher-level skills

**Script Selection Logic:**
```python
skill_level = self.get_skill_level(skill_name)

if is_primitive:  # Level 0 - Primitive skills
    base_command = f"./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/reinforcement_learning/skrl/train.py ..."
elif skill_level == 1:  # Level 1 - First level composite skills
    base_command = f"./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/reinforcement_learning/skrl/train_l1.py ..."
elif skill_level == 2:  # Level 2 - Second level composite skills
    base_command = f"./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/reinforcement_learning/skrl/train_l2.py ..."
else:  # Level 3+ - Higher level composite skills (fallback to L2)
    base_command = f"./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/reinforcement_learning/skrl/train_l2.py ..."
```

**Impact:**
- Ensures appropriate training algorithms are used for each skill type
- Maintains compatibility with existing training infrastructure
- Provides clear fallback mechanism for complex hierarchies

## 4. Active Session Management

### Problem
Users had no way to return to active generation or training sessions when clicking away from the UI window, leading to lost context and monitoring capabilities.

### Solution Implemented
Created a comprehensive active session tracking system with persistent storage:

**New Files Created:**
- `ui/client/src/context/ActiveSessionContext.js` - React context for session management
- `ui/client/src/components/ActiveSessionsIndicator.js` - UI component for session display

**Files Modified:**
- `ui/client/src/App.js` - Added ActiveSessionProvider wrapper
- `ui/client/src/components/Sidebar.js` - Integrated session indicator
- `ui/client/src/pages/CreateTask.js` - Added task generation tracking
- `ui/client/src/pages/TaskDetail.js` - Added training session tracking

### Active Session Context Features

**Session Management:**
```javascript
const value = {
  activeSessions,
  addTaskGeneration,
  removeTaskGeneration,
  addTrainingSession,
  removeTrainingSession,
  getActiveSessionsCount,
  hasActiveSessions,
  getAllActiveSessions
};
```

**Persistence:**
- Sessions are stored in localStorage for browser refresh survival
- Automatic loading and saving of session state
- Persistent tracking across browser sessions

**Session Types:**
- **Task Generation Sessions:** Track ongoing task creation processes
- **Training Sessions:** Monitor active training processes for specific tasks/robots

### Active Sessions Indicator Features

**Visual Indicators:**
- Pulsing orange dot for active sessions
- Expandable/collapsible session list
- Real-time elapsed time display
- Session type icons (Zap for generation, Play for training)

**User Interactions:**
- Click to navigate back to active generation/training
- Remove sessions with confirmation dialogs
- Automatic session cleanup on completion/cancellation

**UI Integration:**
- Integrated into the sidebar for easy access
- Shows session count and details
- Provides direct navigation to active sessions

### Session Tracking Implementation

**Task Generation Tracking:**
```javascript
// When starting task generation
addTaskGeneration(sessionId, taskName, new Date().toISOString());

// When generation completes
removeTaskGeneration();
```

**Training Session Tracking:**
```javascript
// When starting training
addTrainingSession(sessionId, taskName, robot, new Date().toISOString());

// When training completes
removeTrainingSession(sessionId);
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend:** React context-based state management with localStorage persistence
- **Backend:** Session tracking integrated with existing Flask API endpoints
- **UI Components:** Modular design with reusable session management components

### Data Flow
1. User starts task generation/training
2. Session is registered in ActiveSessionContext
3. Session data is persisted to localStorage
4. ActiveSessionsIndicator displays active sessions
5. User can navigate back to active sessions
6. Sessions are cleaned up on completion/cancellation

### Browser Compatibility
- Works across all modern browsers with localStorage support
- Graceful fallback for browsers without localStorage
