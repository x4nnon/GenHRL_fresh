└── obstacle_course_seed123
        📝 Complete the obstacle course by navigating over a low wall, pushing a large sphere, kicking a
        📝       small sphere, and jumping onto a block.
    ├── jump_over_lowWall
    │       📝 Navigate to and jump over the low wall. The robot should end up standing on the opposite
    │       📝           side of the low wall, ready to proceed to the next obstacle.
    │   ├── walk_to_lowWall
    │   │       📝 The robot walks forward until it is positioned directly in front of the low wall, at an
    │   │       📝               appropriate distance to initiate a jump. The robot should be stable and facing the low
    │   │       📝               wall.
    │   ├── execute_jump_over_lowWall
    │   │       📝 The robot performs a jumping action to clear the low wall. The goal state is the robot
    │   │       📝               being airborne over the low wall, or just beginning its descent on the other side.
    │   └── land_after_lowWall_jump
    │           📝 The robot lands safely on the ground on the far side of the low wall and regains a
    │           📝               stable standing posture. The robot is now past the low wall and ready to approach the
    │           📝               large sphere.
    ├── push_largeSphere_towards_highWall
    │       📝 Approach the large sphere and push it until it collides with and pushes over the high wall.
    │       📝           The robot should end up near the large sphere, with the high wall having fallen.
    │   ├── walk_to_largeSphere
    │   │       📝 The robot walks forward until it is positioned directly behind the large sphere, at an
    │   │       📝               appropriate distance to initiate a push. The robot should be stable and facing the large
    │   │       📝               sphere.
    │   ├── push_largeSphere_until_highWall_falls
    │   │       📝 The robot applies continuous force to the large sphere, pushing it along the ground
    │   │       📝               towards the high wall. The skill is complete when the large sphere has made contact with
    │   │       📝               the high wall and the high wall has been knocked over. The robot should remain near the
    │   │       📝               large sphere.
    │   └── stabilize_after_pushing_largeSphere
    │           📝 The robot stabilizes its posture after the pushing action, ensuring it is in a stable
    │           📝               standing position near the large sphere, ready to move to the next obstacle.
    ├── kick_smallSphere_away_from_highWall
    │       📝 Approach the small sphere and kick it away from the high wall. The robot should end up near
    │       📝           the small sphere, with the small sphere having been displaced.
    │   ├── walk_to_smallSphere
    │   │       📝 The robot walks forward until it is positioned appropriately near the small sphere,
    │   │       📝               ready to perform a kicking action. The robot should be stable and facing the small
    │   │       📝               sphere.
    │   ├── execute_kick_smallSphere
    │   │       📝 The robot performs a kicking motion to propel the small sphere away from its current
    │   │       📝               position near the high wall. The skill is complete once the small sphere has been
    │   │       📝               significantly displaced by the kick.
    │   └── stabilize_after_kicking_smallSphere
    │           📝 The robot stabilizes its posture after the kicking action, ensuring it is in a stable
    │           📝               standing position near the small sphere, ready to move to the final obstacle.
    └── jump_on_top_of_blockCube
            📝 Approach the block cube and jump on top of it. The robot should end up standing stably on
            📝           the top surface of the block cube.
        ├── walk_to_blockCube
        │       📝 The robot walks forward until it is positioned directly in front of the block cube, at
        │       📝               an appropriate distance to initiate a jump onto its top surface. The robot should be
        │       📝               stable and facing the block cube.
        ├── execute_jump_on_top_of_blockCube
        │       📝 The robot performs a jumping action to land on top of the block cube. The goal state is
        │       📝               the robot being airborne towards the block cube, or just beginning its descent onto its
        │       📝               top surface.
        └── land_on_top_of_blockCube
                📝 The robot lands safely on the top surface of the block cube and regains a stable
                📝               standing posture. The robot is now on top of the block cube, completing the final
                📝               obstacle.
