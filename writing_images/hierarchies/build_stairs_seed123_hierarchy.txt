    │       📝           top of the Large Block. The goal state is that the Small Block is stably placed on top of
    │       📝           the Medium Block, and the Medium Block is stably placed on top of the Large Block, forming a
    │       📝           three-tiered stair structure. The robot is not holding any blocks and is in a stable
