====================================================================================================
📋 The robot should first walk to the low wall and then jump over it, then the robot should push
the large sphere into the high wall. The sphere hitting the high wall should push it over. The
robot should then walk to a small sphere and kick it away from the wall. Finally the robot
should walk to a 0.5x0.5x0.5 block and jump on top of it.
