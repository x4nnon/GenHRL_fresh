📁 TASK: swimming_diving_board_seed123
====================================================================================================
📋 The robot should walk up two rectangular blocks (one 0.3m high, one 0.6m high), which are 2m
wide and positioned next to each other. It should then walk onto a heavy, balanced 'diving
board' platform located on the top block. The robot must walk along this diving board to its
end, where a small cone is balanced. The robot should then kick this small cone into the
'swimming pool'. After kicking the cone, the robot must perform a diving motion from the diving
board into the 'swimming pool' (represented by a 0.01m high, 4mx4m square plane). Finally, the
robot should act like it is swimming in the pool. The end state requires the small cone to be in
the swimming pool and the robot to be performing a swimming motion within the pool.
