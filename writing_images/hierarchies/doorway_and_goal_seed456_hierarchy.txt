└── doorway_and_goal_seed456
        📝 The robot should walk through the doorway and then walk to the small block.
    ├── approach_doorway
    │       📝 The robot should position itself in front of the doorway, ready to traverse it.
    │   ├── walk_to_doorwayEntrance
    │   │       📝 The robot should walk to a position directly in front of the center of the doorway,
    │   │       📝               ensuring clearance from both doorway walls. The goal state is for the robot's base to be
    │   │       📝               centered and a short distance (e.g., 0.5m) in front of the doorway opening, facing the
    │   │       📝               doorway. This prepares the robot for the next skill of aligning its orientation.

    │   └── align_with_doorwayCenter
    │           📝 The robot should adjust its orientation to face directly through the center of the
    │           📝               doorway. The goal state is for the robot's forward direction to be aligned with the path
    │           📝               through the doorway, from its current position. This ensures a straight path for walking
    │           📝               through the doorway.

    ├── traverse_doorway
    │       📝 The robot should walk completely through the doorway.
    │   └── walk_through_doorwayGap
    │           📝 The robot should move forward until its entire body has passed the plane of the doorway,
    │           📝               and its base is a short distance (e.g., 0.5m) beyond the doorway. The goal state is for
    │           📝               the robot to be fully clear of the doorway walls, positioned on the other side, ready to
    │           📝               approach the next target.

    └── approach_smallBlock
            📝 The robot should walk to the small block after traversing the doorway.
        ├── walk_towards_smallBlock
        │       📝 The robot should move forward in the direction it is facing, towards the general
        │       📝               vicinity of the smallBlock. The goal state is for the robot's base to be within a
        │       📝               reasonable proximity (e.g., 1-2 meters) of the smallBlock, facing generally towards it.
        │       📝               This sets up for the final precise approach.

        └── adjust_position_to_smallBlock
                📝 The robot should make gross adjustments to its position to be directly in front of the
                📝               smallBlock. The goal state is for the robot's base to be directly in front of the
                📝               smallBlock at an appropriate distance (e.g., 0.5m), with its body facing the smallBlock,
                📝               signifying the completion of the task.
