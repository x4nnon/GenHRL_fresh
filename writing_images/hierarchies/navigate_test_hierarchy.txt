📋 The robot navigates to a cone, a cylinder, and a cube in sequence, then returns to its starting
position, and finally performs jumping actions.

└── navigate_test
        📝 The robot navigates to a cone, a cylinder, and a cube in sequence, then returns to its starting
        📝       position, and finally performs jumping actions.
    ├── Navigate_to_Objects_in_Sequence
    │       📝 The robot sequentially walks to the cone, then the cylinder, and then the cube, ensuring it
    │       📝           reaches within 1m of each.
    │   ├── Walk_to_cone
    │   │       📝 The robot walks towards the cone until its base is within 1m of the cone's base. The
    │   │       📝               goal state is achieved when the robot's position is within 1m of the cone, providing a
    │   │       📝               stable configuration to begin walking towards the cylinder.
    │   │       🔧 Object config: 1 path(s)
    │   ├── Walk_to_cylinder
    │   │       📝 The robot walks towards the cylinder until its base is within 1m of the cylinder's base.
    │   │       📝               The goal state is achieved when the robot's position is within 1m of the cylinder,
    │   │       📝               providing a stable configuration to begin walking towards the cube.
    │   │       🔧 Object config: 1 path(s)
    │   └── Walk_to_cube
    │           📝 The robot walks towards the cube until its base is within 1m of the cube's base. The
    │           📝               goal state is achieved when the robot's position is within 1m of the cube, providing a
    │           📝               stable configuration to begin walking back to the start location.

    └── Return_to_Start_and_Jump
            📝 The robot returns to its initial starting position and then performs a sequence of jumping
            📝           actions.
        ├── Walk_to_startLocation
        │       📝 The robot walks towards its initial starting position (0,0) in x and y coordinates until
        │       📝               its base is within 1m of that point. The goal state is achieved when the robot's
        │       📝               position is within 1m of the start location, providing a stable configuration to begin
        │       📝               jumping.

        └── Jump_up_and_down
                📝 The robot performs a sequence of vertical jumps, repeatedly lifting its body off the
                📝               ground and landing. The goal state is achieved after the robot has completed a
                📝               predefined number of jumps, signifying the completion of the task.
