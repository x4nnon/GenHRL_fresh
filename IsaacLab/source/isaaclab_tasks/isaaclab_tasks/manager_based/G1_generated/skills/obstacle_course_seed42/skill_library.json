These objects should be positioned along the x axis in a line, with 3m separating each. The order should be: 1) Low wall, 2) large sphere, 3) high wall, 4) small sphere and 5) block. The robot will start at 0,0,0 and the first object (low wall) should be 3m away in the x axis.

The sphere hitting the high wall should push it over. The robot should then walk to a small sphere and kick it away from the wall. Finally the robot should walk to a 0.5x0.5x0.5 block and jump on top of it. ",
