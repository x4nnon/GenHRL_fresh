I.e the y centre of both objects should be 5.5m apart. which would leave a 0.5m gap. The third object should be a small block of 0.3m cubed. This should be positioned 2m past the doorway in the y axis and 3m down in the y axis.\n\n        Robot task description: The robot should walk through the doorway and then walk to the small block.\n                ",
