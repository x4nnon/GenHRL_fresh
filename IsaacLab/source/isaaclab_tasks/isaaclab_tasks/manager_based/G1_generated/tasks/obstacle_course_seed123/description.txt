 Environment set-up description: The environment should have five objects in it. A wide low wall, 5m in the y-axis and 0.5m in the z and 0.3m in x axis. A large sphere 1m radius. A wide high wall, 5m in the y axis 1m in the z axis and 0.3m in the x axis. A small sphere 0.2m radius. and a block cube of 0.5m cubed. These objects should be positioned along the x axis in a line, with 3m separating each. The order should be: 1) Low wall, 2) large sphere, 3) high wall, 4) small sphere and 5) block. The robot will start at 0,0,0 and the first object (low wall) should be 3m away in the x axis. Such that the robot meets each object sequentially like an obstacle course.  
        
        Robot task description: The robot should first walk to the low wall and then jump over it, then the robot should push the large sphere into the high wall. The sphere hitting the high wall should push it over. The robot should then walk to a small sphere and kick it away from the wall. Finally the robot should walk to a 0.5x0.5x0.5 block and jump on top of it.
