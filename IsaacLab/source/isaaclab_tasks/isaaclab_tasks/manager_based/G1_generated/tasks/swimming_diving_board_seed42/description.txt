The environment should have two rectangualr blocks. one 0.3m high and another 0.6m high. 
                these should be 2m wide. They should be positioned next to each other so the robot can walk up them. 
                There should then be a 'diving board' platform which is balanced on the top block, 
                this should be balance well and heavy enough (very heavy) such that the robot can walk on it without it's COM moving much.
                The robot should walk up the blocks and along the platform. At the end of the platform there should be a small cone balanced.
                the robot should kick this small cone into the 'pool'. The robot must then perform a diving motion onto a 'swimming pool'.
                the swimming pool can be represented by a 0.01m height and 4mx4m square. positioned correctly. The robot should then act like it is swimming.
                The end state should have the cone in the pool and the robot should be swimming.
