  "description": "The robot should walk up two rectangular blocks (one 0.3m high, one 0.6m high), which are 2m wide and positioned next to each other. It should then walk onto a heavy, balanced 'diving board' platform located on the top block. The robot must walk along this diving board to its end, where a small cone is balanced. The robot should then kick this small cone into the 'swimming pool'. After kicking the cone, the robot must perform a diving motion from the diving board into the 'swimming pool' (represented by a 0.01m high, 4mx4m square plane). Finally, the robot should act like it is swimming in the pool. The end state requires the small cone to be in the swimming pool and the robot to be performing a swimming motion within the pool.",
