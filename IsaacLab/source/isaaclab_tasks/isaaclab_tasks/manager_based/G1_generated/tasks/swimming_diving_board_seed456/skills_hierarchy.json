  "description": "The robot should first walk up the Block_Low, then proceed to walk up the Block_High. After reaching the top of the Block_High, the robot should walk onto the DivingBoard and continue walking along its length to the end. At the end of the DivingBoard, the robot must kick the Cone_Small into the SwimmingPool. Following this, the robot should perform a diving motion into the SwimmingPool and then act as if it is swimming within the SwimmingPool. The final state requires the Cone_Small to be inside the SwimmingPool and the robot to be performing a swimming motion.",
