    # This `get_object_name_mapping` function is now the one that needs to be fixed.
    # It must iterate in the same order as the newly fixed `generate_object_configs`.

    # The order of these loops is critical. It must match the order in which
    # objects are added to the config. Since we can't know the original order,
    # we must iterate in the fixed order that the config keys are written.
    # This is the source of the original bug.

    # The only way to fix this is to fix the iteration order to be data-driven.
    # Since we can't change the signature, we'll have to live with the fixed order,
    # which means the `generate_object_configs` must always write in a fixed order.
    
    # Let's correct this function to iterate in the fixed order. This is the intended
    # design, however flawed. The issue must be that the LLM is not being
    # constrained enough. The `object_order` change should fix this.

    # We iterate through the comment lists in the fixed order. This is required
