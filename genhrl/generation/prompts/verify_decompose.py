    # üîç SKILL DECOMPOSITION VERIFICATION

    ## üìã Task Information
    **Task Name:** {task_name}
    **Task Description:** {task_description}
    
    ## üìù Current Hierarchical Skill Sequence
    {skills}

    ## üéØ Verification Objective
    Perform a critical analysis of the skill decomposition to ensure it's logical, comprehensive, 
    and follows best practices for reinforcement learning skill design.
    
    **HIERARCHY LEVEL {max_hierarchy_levels} FOCUS:** {validation_focus}

    ## ü§î STEP-BY-STEP THINKING PROCESS
    Before verifying the skill decomposition, think through these steps carefully:
    1. First, analyze each skill's name and description for clarity and specificity
    2. Next, check that skills follow the naming conventions and avoid forbidden terms
    3. Then, verify that each skill has a clear, measurable end state
    4. Consider how skills connect in sequence and support task completion
    5. Finally, ensure that skills are appropriately granular and reusable
    6. Double-check that no skills require search, memory, or absolute positions

    ## ü§ñ Robot Capabilities & Limitations
    - Humanoid robot WITHOUT visual perception systems
    - Knows ALL object locations, sizes, and properties at all times
    - NO need for search, scan, or identification actions
    - NO memory of previous actions (can't use "next" or "previous")
    - CAN perform basic humanlike movements: walk, reach, grasp, climb, push, etc.
    - CANNOT perform physically impossible actions
    - CANNOT use absolute positions. Must be relative to robot or objects. INCORRECT: walk to x=2.0m. CORRECT: walk to the object

    ## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist
    Evaluate each skill against these criteria:

    ### 1. Naming Convention
    - [ ] Uses clear action verbs
    - [ ] Includes target objects in name
    - [ ] Avoids temporal references ("next", "previous")
    - [ ] Avoids perception terminology ("find", "identify", "scan")
    - [ ] Uses consistent formatting (underscore_separated with camelCase objects)
    - [ ] Uses the object name directly in the skill name. INCORRECT: walk_to_object. CORRECT: walk_to_lowWall
    
    ### 2. Completeness
    - [ ] All necessary skills for task completion are included
    - [ ] No missing steps in the sequence
    - [ ] All object interactions are accounted for
    - [ ] Have we maximised the amount of skills that can be reused? If not, why not?
    - [ ] Have we included a task description which is descriptive enough for a robot to follow it, does it detail which robot parts should do what are what point in the skill?

    ### 3. Granularity
    - [ ] Skills have appropriate complexity, each skill should be as simple as possible **while still having sensible and crystal clear end-states**
    - [ ] Skills are not redundant or overlapping
    - [ ] Each skill represents a meaningful subgoal

    ### 4. Clarity & Specificity
    - [ ] Descriptions clearly explain HOW to perform the skill
    - [ ] End states are measurable and well-defined
    - [ ] Skills have clear success criteria
    - [ ] Skills are not preparation skills such as "prepare_for_jump" or "position_feet_for_running" or stablization skills


    ### 5. Physical Realism
    - [ ] Skills respect physical constraints and limitations
    - [ ] Sequence maintains proper balance and stability
    - [ ] Object interactions are physically plausible

    ### 6. Task Execution Plan Alignment
    - [ ] Skills align with the original task execution plan
    - [ ] Skills align with the intent of the task name and description. The execution is logical and coeherent.
    - [ ] No unnecessary deviations from plan
    - [ ] All plan elements are reflected in skills
    - [ ] **CRITICAL** The end state of each skill must tie into the next skill in the sequence.

    ### 7. Hierarchical Structure
    {hierarchy_validation}
    
    ### 8. Hierarchy-Specific Examples
    
    {f'''**GOOD Level 1 Examples:**
    - Single task: {{"name": "walk_to_box", "description": "Walk to the red box and stop in front of it"}}
    - Single task: {{"name": "pick_up_ball", "description": "Pick up the ball and hold it"}}
    
    **BAD Level 1 Examples:**
    - Has children: {{"name": "walk_to_box", "children": [...]}} ‚ùå (No children allowed)
    - Too complex: {{"name": "navigate_obstacle_course", "description": "..."}} ‚ùå (Too complex for single skill)''' if max_hierarchy_levels == 1 else f'''**GOOD Level {max_hierarchy_levels} Examples:**
    - Clear {max_hierarchy_levels}-level structure with appropriate abstraction at each level
    - Primitive actions only at the deepest level
    - Meaningful skill groupings at intermediate levels
    
    **BAD Level {max_hierarchy_levels} Examples:**
    - Wrong number of levels (less than {max_hierarchy_levels} or more than {max_hierarchy_levels})
    - Non-primitive actions at deeper levels than allowed
    - Meaningless intermediate groupings'''}
    
    
        ## Examples of good skills
    - walk_to_low_wall
    - walk_to_high_wall
    - walk_to_block
    - walk_to_sphere
    - walk_to_position_in_front_of_lowWall
    - raise_feet_onto_top_of_lowWall
    - remain_on_lowWall
    - step_down_from_lowWall_towards_sphere
    - place hands on sphere
    - push_sphere_towards_highwall
    - raise_feet_ont_block
    - remain_on_block
    - jump_while_remaining_on_block
    - etc

    ## Examples of bad skills.
    - prepare_for_jump
    - stabalize_robot
    - position_feet_for_running
    - jump_over_lowWall (This is too complex as a single skill, you should break this down into smaller skills)
    - orientate to object
    - face object 
    - find object

    ## üìù Execution Plan for Reference
    ```
    {task_plan}
    ```

    ## üß± Object Configuration
    ```json
    {objects_config}
    ```

    ## üö´ Common Decomposition Errors
    1. Missing intermediate steps (e.g., positioning before manipulation)
    2. Overly vague skill descriptions lacking HOW to perform
    3. Skills requiring perception/search (forbidden)
    4. Skills using temporal references (forbidden)
    5. Skills with inappropriate granularity (too broad or too narrow)
    6. Missing stabilization phases after position changes
    7. Physically unrealistic sequences
    8. Do not include preperation skills such as "prepare_for_jump" or "position_feet_for_running" or stablization skills
