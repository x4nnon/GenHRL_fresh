    - PREFERRED: Use descriptive names like "lowWall", "sphere", "redCube" from the object comments
    - ACCEPTABLE: Use Object1, Object2, etc. if descriptive names are unclear
    - NEVER USE: Relative terms like "nearest", "largest", "closest"
    
    {hierarchy_guidance}
    
    ## Planning Objective
    Create a precise, sequential plan for a reinforcement learning robot to accomplish the task. This plan will guide the creation of reusable skills. You should attempt to explain completing the task with reusable skills where possible.

    ## ü§î STEP-BY-STEP THINKING PROCESS
    Before creating the plan, think through these steps carefully:
    1. First, analyze the task description and object mapping to identify key objects and their descriptive names
    2. Next, break down the task into logical phases (approach, interaction, completion)
    3. Then, identify which robot parts will be needed for each phase
    4. Consider how each phase connects to the next, ensuring smooth transitions
    5. Finally, verify that each step uses descriptive object names and is physically possible
    6. Double-check that no steps require search, memory, absolute positions, or relative terms

    ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Constraints
    - Robot training is expensive - prioritize reusable skills
    - Skills must be general enough to be used across tasks
    - The robot has NO visual search capabilities
    - The robot has NO memory of previous actions
    - The plan should not use absolute positions. INCORRECT: walk to x=2.0m. CORRECT: walk to lowWall
    - **Use descriptive object names** - Reference objects using their descriptive names from object configuration. PREFERRED: walk to lowWall. ACCEPTABLE: walk to Object1. INCORRECT: walk to nearestWall
    - **NO relative or ambiguous terms** - Never use "nearest", "largest", "closest", "leftmost" etc.

    
    ## ‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN SKILLS
    DO NOT plan for skills that involve:
    1. Identifying objects
    2. Finding/searching for objects
    3. Determining object properties
    4. Scanning the environment
    5. Skills with specific object parameters
    6. Skills using temporal terms (next, previous)
    7. preperation skills such as "prepare_for_jump" or "position_feet_for_running"
    8. Orientation to objects
    
    ## üìù Naming Convention Requirements
    - **Use descriptive object names from object configuration** (e.g., "walk_to_lowWall", "jump_over_sphere")
    - PREFERRED: Extract descriptive names from object comments (lowWall, sphere, redCube, etc.)
    - ACCEPTABLE: Use Object1-Object5 references if object names are unclear
    - **NO relative descriptors** - Never use "smaller", "larger", "nearest", "leftmost", etc.
    - **NO ambiguous terms** - Be explicit and specific about which object is referenced
    
    ## üëç GOOD Skill Examples
    - "walk_to_lowWall" ‚úì (descriptive object name, clear and reusable)
    - "pick_up_redCube" ‚úì (descriptive object name, clear target)
    - "stack_redCube_on_platform" ‚úì (descriptive object relationship)
    - "jump_over_lowWall" ‚úì (clear action on specific object)
    - "push_sphere_towards_goalZone" ‚úì (descriptive object interaction)
    - "walk_to_Object1" ‚úì (acceptable if object description unclear)
    
    ## üëé BAD Skill Examples
    - "identify_largest_object" ‚úó (robot already knows object properties)
    - "find_next_block" ‚úó (uses temporal term, no search needed)
    - "walk_to_nearest_sphere" ‚úó (uses relative term "nearest", should be "walk_to_sphere")
    - "pick_up_smallest_cube" ‚úó (uses relative term "smallest", should be "pick_up_redCube")
    - "walk_to_largest_wall" ‚úó (uses relative term "largest", should be "walk_to_highWall")
    - "walk_to_specific_object" ‚úó (too generic, not descriptive, and we can't pass the object to the skill)
    - "determine_stacking_location" ‚úó (decision-making, not action)
    - "prepare_for_jump" ‚úó (preparation, not action)
    - "position_feet_for_running" ‚úó (preparation, not action)
    
    ## üß† Robot Knowledge Context
    The robot ALREADY KNOWS:
    - All object locations, sizes, and properties
    - Relative positions of everything in the scene
    - No need for search, scan, or identification steps
    
    ## Expected Plan Format
    Provide a numbered, sequential plan with 5-15 distinct steps. Each step should:
    1. Clearly describe a specific action or movement
    2. Reference specific objects by their properties
    3. Include necessary positioning and orientation
    4. Avoid any search or identification actions
    
    **CRITICAL**: Provide ONLY a concise numbered list. Do NOT create ASCII art, diagrams, charts, or visual representations with dashes, lines, or symbols. Keep all descriptions brief and text-only.
