    ## üìã Skill Information
    **Skill Name:** {skill_name}
    **Skill Description:** {skill_description}
    
    ## üß± Object Configuration
    ```json
    {objects_config}
    ```
    
    ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL OBJECT NAMING**: Objects in the scene are named Object1, Object2, Object3, Object4, Object5 only.
    Use the object configuration above to understand what each ObjectN represents (e.g., Object1 might be a ball, Object3 might be a wall).
    You MUST access objects using these exact names: env.scene['Object1'], env.scene['Object2'], etc.
    
    ## üìù Current Success Implementation
    ```python
    {success_code}
    ```
    
    ## üéØ Verification Objective
    Perform a comprehensive review of the success criteria implementation to identify any issues, 
    errors, or potential improvements in the code.

    CRITICAL verification check. 
    - you must check that NO accessing functions or data attributes that are not explicitly shown in the examples.
    - you must check that none of the common errors have been made.

    ## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist
    
    ### 1. Correctness & Alignment
    - [ ] Success criteria correctly match the skill description
    - [ ] Logic correctly determines successful skill completion
    - [ ] Thresholds are reasonable and justified
    - [ ] Duration requirements are appropriate
    - [ ] Success criteria aligns with the rewards functions
    
    ### 2. Code Quality & Safety
    - [ ] No potential runtime errors (divide by zero, index errors, etc.)
    - [ ] Properly handles edge cases and exceptions
    - [ ] Uses direct object access patterns
    - [ ] No hardcoded indices or magic numbers without comments
    
    ### 3. Data Access Patterns
    - [ ] Only uses allowed methods and attributes. Those shown in the examples are the only ones used?
    - [ ] No storage of variables on env object
    - [ ] Correctly handles object existence/non-existence
    - [ ] Uses proper tensor operations
    - [ ] Uses relative distances instead of absolute positions
    - [ ] Uses correct Object1...Object5 naming based on object configuration
    
    ### 4. Implementation Completeness
    - [ ] Includes necessary primary success conditions
    - [ ] Includes appropriate secondary conditions (if needed)
    - [ ] Properly checks duration with check_success_duration
    - [ ] Saves success states when environments succeed
    - [ ] Success criteria are not too restrictive or permissive. 
    - [ ] Instantaneous velocities can be high on robot body parts. These should be avoided.
    - [ ] You do not know the dimensions of the robot. You should NOT use arbitrary values for positions of limbs or pelvis. You do not know if this is correct.
    
    ## üö´ Common Implementation Errors
    
    1. **Access Pattern Errors**
       - Using non-existent object methods/attributes
       - Using env.variable to store state
       - Accessing objects using incorrect patterns
       - Using incorrect tensor dimensions
       - Using quat_rotate_vector or mdp.quat_rotate_vector ----> quat_rotate_vector and mdp.quat_rotate_vector is undefined.
        - using AttributeError: object.cfg.size ---> 'RigidObjectCfg' object has no attribute 'size'
       - Using incorrect object names (must be Object1, Object2, Object3, Object4, or Object5)
       
    2. **Logical Errors**
       - Too restrictive criteria (making success impossible)
       - Too permissive criteria (allowing "fake" success)
       - Missing necessary conditions
       - Incorrect mathematical calculations
    
    3. **Physical Errors**
       - Unrealistic thresholds
       - Physically impossible requirements
       - Inconsistent units
       - Missing stability conditions
    
    4. **Technical Errors**
       - Missing duration checks
       - Missing success state saving
       - Tensor device mismatches
       - Failing to handle multiple environments
